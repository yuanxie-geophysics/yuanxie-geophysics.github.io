Hi there!
I am Yuan Xie from China University of Geosciences (Wuhan). I just finished defended my dissertation at School of Geophysics and Geomatics, China Univeristy of Geosciences (Wuhan) in Nov.2024, and will continue work as a postdoc in China Univerisity of Geosciences (Wuhan). 
My supervisors 
graduated from School of Mechanical Science and Engineering,  Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan China. with a doctor’s degree, advised by Yihua Kang and from School of Mechanical Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu China with a bachelor’s degree.

My research interest includes: 
- Geodynamics
- thermo-mechanical numerical modeling 
- Plate tectonics
- Collision zones
- Orogenic formation
